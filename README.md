This is a little program in which you can select a folder, and then 3 random images from within that folder will show up. 
You can hit refresh to get 3 new random images. Save screenshot will save the three images into one image in the program folder.

I made it as a tool for myself as a concept artist, to do design excercises, and come up with ideas I may not have otherwise come up with.

It's my first time making my own little program,
Hope you enjoy it!
